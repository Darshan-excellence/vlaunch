Introduction
------------

Vlaunch is a cross-platform utility that is used to start an operating system installed on a device - such as a USB key - very easily. To do so, it makes use of [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org) to create a virtual machine from the USB key, configure it and run it.

Vlaunch is written in Go and uses the awesome [Qt bindings for Go](https://github.com/therecipe/qt) and [VirtualBox Go bindings](https://github.com/pwnall/vbox)
